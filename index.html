      <h1>Interactive Choropleth Map</h1>
      <hr />
      <p>The purpose of this project is to provide a resource for those who would like to develop or use a professionally designed interactive choropleth map.</p>
      <hr />
      <p>This project was spawned from one of the assignments given out at the 3rd <a href="http://phillygivecamp.org/">Philly Give Camp</a>.  <a href="https://github.com/jennvoss/gpcah-map">The original project</a> was the answer to a request from the <a href="http://www.hungercoalition.org/">Coalition Against Hunger</a> to create an interactive choropleth map for the purpose of peoperly displaying information gathered in most comprehensive report on hunger in the state of pennsylvania ever generated.</p>
      <p>On the drive home from the Philly Give Camp, I got to thinking about all of the improvements that we could do to make this project even better.  By the time I got home, I decided what the project really needed was a complete re-write.</p>
      <p>And thus, this project was born.</p>

  <h2>Project Goals:</h2>
  <div class="row-fluid">
    <div class="span4">
      <h3>Create Base Map</h3>
      <p>Our first goal should be to create an interactive choropleth map based on the <a href="http://leafletjs.com/examples/choropleth.html"><b class="icon-leaf"></b> Leaflet</a> tutorial.</p>
      <p><a class="btn" href="http://leafletjs.com/examples/choropleth.html">View tutorial</a></p>

    <div class="span4">
      <h3>Standard geoJSON data import</h3>
      <p>Follow the correct standards on using geoJSON to input information, including any "report" information, into the map.</p>
    </div><!--/span-->
    <div class="span4">
      <h3>Map Control Layer</h3>
      <p>Output the report data into a leaflet map control layer.  This is the most browser compatible way to displaying data from the report.</p>
    </div><!--/span-->
  </div><!--/row-->
  <div class="row-fluid">
    <div class="span4">
      <h3>CSS Style Convention</h3>
      <p>Import all map styles from a CSS file.  Currently the tutorial hard-codes this into the javascript.  This goes against typical web-conventions</p>
    </div><!--/span-->
    <div class="span4">
      <h3>Google Docs Spreadsheet Support</h3>
      <p>Extend the geoJSON import function to allow for data to be fed in directly from a public google docs spreadsheet.</p>
    </div><!--/span-->
    <div class="span4">
      <h3>Style Map Control Layer</h3>
      <p>Using only CSS, change the location of the map control layer to be outside of the map-area.  Try to accomplish this without changing the javascript at all.  Currently the map control layer works perfectly in all browsers, perhaps more advanced styling should be limited to IE9+ and all standards browsers.</p>
